example.py
input -> output
        Description
------------------------------Helper Files--------------------------------------
1. helper.py
        Utility file which acts as library of common functions.

2. datetime_parser.py
        Utility file that formats inputs into valid date time formats. Functions have been copied to helper.py so this now acts as a reference file.

3. unitTest.py
        Tester file for helper.py file. To run, on a local machine not the server run python unitTest.py in the command line.

-----------------------------Volunteer actions----------------------------------
1. signup.py:
{firstName, lastName, email, phone, password, phone_type, birth} -> {Success:True}/400
        This function will take in all the information from the signup page and create a new person in the database (with admin_status: False) with the corresponding values. 
        The password is hashed and salted using hashlib (see helper.py). Currently the phone number, provider, and birth date are only used so that the admins can observe
        them using get_volunteer_info.py.

2. login.py:
{email,password} -> {firstname,lastname,email,phone_number,phone_provider, admin_status, driver_status, desired_hours, assigned_hours, assigned_job_ids, userID, enventsIDs}
        This function takes in the email and the attempted password, then finds the salt of the given user (based on email) and hashes the attempted password and compares 
        with the hashed password that was set during signup.py. If they match then success is given to the frontend, if not a 400 is passed back. If the login was successful 
        though all the information the frontend needs about the user is given so that they have it in scope. Things to note: The assigned _hours corresponds with the total 
        hours added up of all that user's jobs and the eventIDs are all the events this person has submitted free time for.

3. set_availability.py: 
{eventID, userID, available_times(date:[timerange1,timerange2],date2:[timerange1....),desired_hours} -> {Success:True}/400
        This function will take in the user who is submitting their times, which event they are submitting for, and a time object with all the information about date, begin 
        and end times of their availability (see above) and create entries in the availability table in the database corresponding to all of the time ranges passed in. It is 
        important to know that the way we are storing free time in our database is in 30 minute chunks, so if I am free 2:00 to 4:00 then in the database will be 4 separate 
        entries: 2:00,2:30,3:00,3:30 where the 2:00 entry refers to the chunk 2-2:30 and the 2:30 chunk refers to 2:30-3. Also the desired hours are set here 
        (the amount each volunteer wants to work).

4. delete_availability
{eventId, volunteerId, date, time} -> {Success:True}/400
        File that deletes volunteer times from volunteer availability. Times are given as time ranges and all availability nodes in between are deleted. NOTE: If a volunteer 
        is assigned during one of the nodes the node will not be deleted but a success will still return for all other nodes which were deleted.

5. confirm_job
{eventId, jobId} -> {job_status}
        Allows volunteers to change the status of a job to confirmed. Admins can see that a volunteer has seen their assigned jobs and that they will show up for them. Updates VMS_jobs.

6. complete_job
{eventId, jobId} -> {job_status}
        A file which allows volunteers to change the status of a job to completed. Currently not in use but would allow admins to see completed jobs. Updates VMS_jobs.

-----------------------------Admin actions--------------------------------------
1. create_event
{eventname, startdate, enddate} -> {Success:True}/400
        Creates events in a certain date range for the site. IMPORTANT: All events must be valid or login and signup will fail. Events are stored in VMS_events

2. create_job
{event_id, job_name, job_date, job_time_start, job_time_end, location, job_description} -> {Success:True}/400
        Creates a job for a specific event. Jobs are stored in VMS_jobs.

3. create_skill(Not deployed on website)
{skill_name, skill_description} -> {Success:True}/400
	creates a skill.
	This skill could be used as an attribute for a job in the future.

4. delete_job 
{job_id}-> {Success:True}/400
	Delete a job.
	If someone is assigned to this job, then remove the corrsbonding jobId in their VMS_volunteer_availability table.

5. assign_job
{eventId, jobId, VolunteerId} -> {Success:True}/400
	Assign volunteer to a job associated with an event.
	In VMS_jobs table, person_pk will be filled with this volunteerId.
	And in VMS_volunteer_availability, the corresbonding time slot will also be marked by this jobId.

6. unassign_job
{jobId, volunteerId} -> {Success:True}/400
	Unassign volunteer to a job
	In VMS_jobs table, person_pk will be set to null.
	And in VMS_volunteer_availability, the corresbonding time slot will also be set as null.

7. force_assign

8. upgrade_volunteer:
{ userID, (admin:T/F), (driver:T/F)} -> success
    This function will take in a user id, and 2 json objects of admin and driver each with a boolean value after the colon. The python file will then set the
    admin status and the driver status of the given user in the data base to either true or false depending on the input. The file will then return success

---------------------------Info Return Files------------------------------------
1. get_volunteers_available:
{jobID} -> {person1:[name,desired_hours,assigned_hours],person2....]}
    This function takes in a jobID and returns all of the volunteers in the database with corresponding free time (along with relevant information like how many 
    hours they are already working). It is important to know for this function that two important helper functions are called: the first, time_rounder, 
    the job into times that match the fact volunteers are available only in thirty minute increments (i.e. a job from 2:45-3:00 will look for people
    that are free from 2:30 to 3:00), and the second, person_filter, deals with the corner case where the Between command gives volunteers only if they 
    are free thirty minutes after the job time in addition to the normal.

2. get_all_availability
{eventID} -> {volunteer1:{availability, desired_hours, jobs:{name,date,userID,event,start_time,end_time,description,status}}, volunteer2...}
	This function takes in an an eventID and returns every volunteer that has submitted free time for the event, with all of their availability, their desired
	hours, and all jobs assigned to them (each jobs is also a json object with all its details included). This is call is one of our most involved since
	the available times object for each volunteer is very large (same format as set_availability), and each job includes all its info.

3. get_all_peoples
{} -> {person1:{firstname,lastname,email,phone_number,admin_status,birthdate,desiredhours,assignedhours,jobs}
	This function takes in nothing, but returns all the users in the database along with all their info except their available times. 

4. get_event_jobs
{eventID} -> {job1:{name,eventID,userID,date,startTime,endTime,location,description,status},job2...}
	This function takes in an event and returns all the jobs in that event with all their information.

5. get_event_peoples
{eventId} -> {person1:{first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, phone_provider, admin_status, date_of_birth, driver_status, desired_hours, assigned_hours, assigned_job_ids},person2...}
	This function takes in an event and returns all the persons in that event with all their information.

6. get_events
{} -> {event1:{event_name, eventDays},event2...}
	This function takes in nothing, but returns all the events in the database with all their info. 

7. get_job_info
{jobId} -> {event_id, person_pk, job_time_start, job_time_end, location, job_description, job_name, job_status}
	This function takes in an job and returns all this job information.

8. get_one_volunteer_info
{volunteerId} -> {first_name, last_name, email, phone_number, phone_provider, admin_status, date_of_birth, driver_status, desired_hours, assigned_hours, assigned_job_ids}
	This function takes in an volunteer and returns all this person information.

9. get_skill
{skillID} -> {ID, name , description}
	This function returns all of the information about a skill given its id. We have not implemented the use of skills for our system
	yeet so this function is never called from the FrontEnd. 

10. get_volunteer_availability
{userID, eventID} -> { availabletimes} 
	This function takes in a userID and an event and returns all the availble times that person has given for that 	specfic event. 
	The format of returned time ranges looks much like the format for set_availability (date:[timerange1,timerange2],date2:[timerange1....).
	
11. get_volunteer_events
{userID} -> {events}
	This function takes a userID and returns all events that the given user has given availability for.

12. get_volunteer_job_ids.py:
{userID,eventID} -> {jobs:[ids...], availabilityCheck:T/F}
    The function will take in a volunteer and a specific event just like the get_volunteers_available.py, but this time only a list of the jobIDs is given 
    back in addition to a check to see if the user has inputted any times they would be available for the event that was passed in.

13. get_volunteer_jobs:
{ userID, eventID} -> {job1:[name,eventID,userID,date,startTime,endTime,location,description,status],job2:..
    This function will take in a volunteer and a specific event and return all the corresponding assigned jobs as json objects with all of the information 
    of the given job (see output above) . Note that the index of the dictionary is the jobID.
